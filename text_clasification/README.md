We classified two datasets and used four main types of classifiers: classical machine learning, BERT, and RoBERTa. The two datasets are:

- **Vaccination Recovery News Dataset**: The Recovery News dataset is a publicly available dataset on COVID-19. We distilled articles specifically on vaccination. This is also the dataset from which I produced synthetic news.
- **MMCoVaR Dataset**: A publicly available dataset on COVID-19, composed of news and tweets. I used the news portion of this dataset.
